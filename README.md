Autonomous Mower – Arduino Uno (C)

This project is a simple autonomous mower prototype built with an Arduino Uno.
The mower moves forward and uses obstacle detection sensors to avoid collisions.
Features:

    ✅ Programmed in C for the Arduino platform

    ✅ Compatible with Arduino Uno

    ✅ Obstacle detection and basic avoidance logic

    ✅ Ideal for learning robotics and embedded programming
